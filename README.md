# Convolutional Neural Networks Classification of Lung Tissue Images 
## Introduction
### Lung Tumors
A lung tumor is a tumor that occurs in the lung tissue itself or in the airways that lead to the lungs. Lung tumors can be either cancerous (malignant) or benign (non-cancerous). Benign tumors are not cancerous, so they will not spread to other parts of the body. They grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink, and they are usually not life-threatening and do not need to be removed. For cancerous tumors, there are two main types, and the one we will focus on are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

About 80% to 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These subtypes, which start from different types of lung cells are grouped together as NSCLC because their treatment and prognoses (outlook) are often similar. The two subtypes of NSCLC we will focus on are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
- **Adenocarcinoma**

  Adenocarcinomas start in the cells that would normally secrete substances such as mucus. This type of lung cancer occurs mainly in current or former smokers, but it is also the most common type of lung cancer seen in non-smokers. It is more common in   women than in men, and it is more likely to occur in younger people than other types of lung cancer.
  Adenocarcinoma is usually found in the outer parts of the lung and is more likely to be found before it has spread.

- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**

  Squamous cell carcinomas start in squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in the lungs. They are often linked to a history of    smoking and tend to be found in the central part of the lungs, near a main airway (bronchus).

### Histopathology
Histopathology refers to the microscopic examination of tissue in order to study the manifestations of disease. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. The [histopathological image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images) we will use is created by [Andrew A. Borkowski et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12142v1) (2019).

### Convolutional Neural Networks
In recent years, neural networks have become one of the best-performing artificial-intelligence systems in many fields. neural networks combine many nonlinear functions to model the complicated relationship between input features and output labels. They are applied in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, character recognition, signature verification, and many others. With the utilization of large data sets and high computing power, neural networks can adapt to varying conditions and have demonstrated high accuracy in various tasks. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are primarily used in image processing and recognition. The convolutional layer, the pooling layer, and the fully connected layer are three basic building blocks of CNNs.
